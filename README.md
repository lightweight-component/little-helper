# 🏗️ Deployment
## ⚡ Fast way

## 🪧 For developers to install
If u r a developer, u want to code it, then u should install all environments. It's a project of standard NodeJS, so u just install the dependences by:

```
npm install
```
And then run it:

    npm run dev

Beware of the version for NodeJS, I'm using v20.13.1. Plus this is a project of [Cloudflare Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).
```
npm run deploy
```

# 🚗 Roadmap
